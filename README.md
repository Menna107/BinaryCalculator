# 🔢 Number System Converter (Python)

A simple **console-based Python application** that allows users to convert numbers between different numbering systems:

* Decimal (Base 10)
* Binary (Base 2)
* Octal (Base 8)
* Hexadecimal (Base 16)

This project is fully menu-driven and implemented using pure Python without external libraries.

## 📌 Project Idea

The goal of this project is to practice:

* Problem solving
* Algorithmic thinking
* Number base conversions
* Python functions
* Modular programming
* Input validation
* Menu-driven systems

---

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Convert between all bases:

* Decimal → Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal
* Binary → Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal
* Octal → Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal
* Hexadecimal → Decimal, Binary, Octal

✅ Menu-based interface
✅ Input validation
✅ Clean function-based structure
✅ No external libraries required

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User chooses to insert a number
2. Selects the base of the number (from)
3. Selects the target base (to)
4. Program converts the number using custom algorithms
5. Result is printed on the screen

---

## 🖥️ Example

```
Input Number: 15
From Base: Decimal
To Base: Binary

Output: 1111
```

---

## 🚀 How To Run

```bash
Binary Project.py
```
